# Welcome to My Portfolio!

This github is a place where you can see my thorough documentation of my website. I use this as an example of what I could do given your company's version control system, whichever you may be using.

I'm knowledgable in React, Express.js, Redux Toolkit, and more. Capable of making high-scale functional websites and working in an agile team with ease, I want to use this as an example to show my prowess when it comes to functional and efficient coding.
